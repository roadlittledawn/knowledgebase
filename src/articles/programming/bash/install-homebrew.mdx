To install `homebrew` on Mac M3:

1. Download it:

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

1. Mac M1, M2, M3

On newer Apple Silicon machines, there's one more step to install Homebrew on a Mac. Homebrew files are installed into the /opt/homebrew folder. But the folder is not part of the default $PATH.

Homebrew checks the shell configuration

`$PATH` is a shell environment variable that shows where executable programs are located. When you run a command in the terminal, the shell searches through the directories listed in your $PATH variable to find the executable file for that command. With a correct $PATH, you don't need to type the full path to a program every time you want to run it.

The Homebrew install script will check if you've previously set a $PATH that includes the Homebrew folders (this is likely if you installed Homebrew previously).

## Add to the PATH setting (first time users)

If you're a first time Homebrew user, Homebrew will display instructions to set the $PATH environment variable, as well as other Homebrew-related environment variables.

Homebrew shows instructions at the end of the installation process. Follow Homebrew's advice and set up a ~/.zprofile file which contains a command which sets up Homebrew:

`homebrew` will tell you to run these two commands:

```bash
==> Next steps:
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your `$PATH`:
    (echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> ~/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

I also add that to `.zshrc` as well.

## More context

The example above contains the Unix `~` tilde shortcut. The Homebrew console output will show your user directory name instead.

Be very careful to copy the commands exactly. It's best to copy and paste. If you enter the commands manually and you enter a single `>` instead of the double >> you will replace the .zprofile instead of appending.

The shell eval command executes the commands in the shellenv file found in the `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` folder.

### Alternative shell configuration

Alternatively, you can use a text editor to edit the `~/.zprofile` file. For TextEdit, use open ~/.zprofile to edit the file. You'll need to add the line eval `"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` to the file.

Here's what a Homebrew `$PATH` setting looks like:

```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Some developers don't use the ~/.zprofile file, preferring to set the shell configuration in the ~/.zshrc file. The article .zshrc or .zprofile explains the differences. Homebrew recommends using the ~/.zprofile file.
