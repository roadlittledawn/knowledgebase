Save the script as a .sh file, for example, "move_files.sh". Make sure to change the values of SOURCE_DIR and DEST_DIR variables to the correct directories in your own file system. Then, run the script using the command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the source directory where the files are currently located
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source/directory"

# Set the destination directory where the files will be moved to
DEST_DIR="/path/to/destination/directory"

# Use the find command to locate all files in the source directory and its subdirectories
find "$SOURCE_DIR" -type f -print0 |

# Use the xargs command to move the files to the destination directory
xargs -0 -I {} mv {} "$DEST_DIR"
```
