# Difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile

Difference between `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` is that `.bash_profile` is executed for login shells, while `.bashrc` is executed for interactive non-login shells.

When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via `ssh`: `.bash_profile` is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.

# Example

```bash
# if homebrew `brew` not available by default
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

# make nvm available
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# make nvm available apple silicon
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
# This loads nvm
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"

# If above doesn't work try this
# export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
# This loads nvm
# [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"


# This loads nvm bash_completion
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"

# nvm docs say to do this
# source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh

# bash completion script on apple intel
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

# use version of node specified in .nvmrc
if [[ -f .nvmrc ]]; then
    nvm use
fi

# some handy git command shorthands
alias gpush='git push origin HEAD'
alias gpull='git pull'
```
