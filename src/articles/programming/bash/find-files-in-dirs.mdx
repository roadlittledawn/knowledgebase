Create file of list of directories without a specified file in them

```bash
find src/content/docs -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 7 -type d '!' -exec test -e "{}/index.mdx" ';' -print > auto-index-dirs.txt
```

Get count of all files in given directory with particular file extension

```bash
find src/content/docs -mindepth 1 -type f -name "*.mdx" | wc -l
# or using ls
ls -lR src/content/docs/**/*.mdx | wc -l
# look for multiple file extensions
ls -lR src/content/whats-new/**/*.(png|gif|jpg|jpeg) | wc -l
```

Find all files and directories that have a particular string in them. For example, all the files and directories that have the string `install` in them.

```bash
# Search files and directories
find src/content/docs -name "*install*" | wc -l
# Search only files
find src/content/docs -type f -name "*install*" | wc -l
# Search only directories
find src/content/docs -type d -name "*install*" | wc -l
```
