# Getting verified commits

Setting up verified commits adds a little security to our process. This ensures that a commit came from your machine and not someone else remotely pretending to commit as you. When someone's commits are verified you'll see a label next to them.

First we'll need to install something called GPG. You can do this with homebrew:

```bash
brew install gpg
```

Once that's installed you can use it to create a key by running this command:

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

This will trigger a series of prompts which you can answer like so:

Your selection? **1**

What keysize do you want? (3072) **4096**

Key is valid for? (0) **0**

Key does not expire at all Is this correct? (y/N) **y**

You'll also be asked for your name and email address (the one you use with github) as well as a "comment". You can leave the comment blank and hit enter.

Here's an example of the full output:

```bash
reli ~ gpg --full-generate-key
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.3; Copyright (C) 2023 g10 Code GmbH
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

gpg: directory '/Users/reli/.gnupg' created
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Reli Relic
Email address: rrelic@newrelic.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Reli Relic <rrelic@newrelic.com>"
```

You should then be prompted to create a password (twice). Make sure to save this somewhere! You'll see some output which you can ignore. Now you can run this command to see your key:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

Which will return something like this:

```bash
reli ~ % gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
[keyboxd]
---------
sec   rsa4096/YOUR_KEY_ID 2023-07-18 [SC]
     ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123ABC123
uid                 [ultimate] Reli Relic <rrelic@newrelic.com>
ssb   rsa4096/ABC123ABC123 2023-07-18 [E]
```

Now you can copy the value you see replaced by `YOUR_KEY_ID` in the above example. It might be a good idea to paste this somewhere temporarily since you'll be coming back to use it a few times.

Run this command and paste in your value in place of `YOUR_KEY_ID`

```bash
 gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID
```

You should get an output that looks like this:

```bash
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

numbersandletters378468734658734somanynumbers83475837485
numbersandletters378468734658734somanynumbers83475837485
numbersandletters378468734658734somanynumbers83475837485
numbersandletters378468734658734somanynumbers83475837485

numbersandletters378468734658734somanynumbers83475837485

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

Copy the entire block including the begin and end comments. In github you'll navigate to your profile -> settings -> SSH and GPG keys. Here you can click "New GPG key", name it whatever you'd like, and paste in the previous block. Hit save and you're done in github.

Now we'll adjust some settings in git by running these commands with `YOUR_KEY_ID` being replaced by your key from earlier:

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Now you can run a test to see how things are working. You'll probably need to enter the password you created with gpg earlier.

```bash
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign
```

If you get an error and not a block of scrambled text (similar to the block you pasted in github) you can try running this command and then trying the test again:

```bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

If things are still wonky you can try running the following to kill the gpg client:

```bash
gpgconf --kill all
gpg-agent --daemon
```

Finally, try out a commit! If you use github desktop it's probably a good idea to quit/restart the app before committing. If an error occurs reach out to #doc_eng_help.
