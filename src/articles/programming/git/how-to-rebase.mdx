# rebase to clean / reorg commit history

To use rebase interactively for last N commits, run:

```
git rebase -i HEAD~N
```

Squash all commits except one. I choose the oldest one so I don't get previous commit error. You can also `reword` if you want to eventually reword the git commit message.

I sometimes I have to force push if git gets angry

```
git push origin HEAD --force
```

Show recent commits

```
git log -n 5
git show -3
```
