# rebase to clean / reorg commit history

To use rebase interactively for last `N` commits, run:

```
git rebase -i HEAD~N
```

Using `vim` editor, squash all commits except one. I choose the oldest one so I don't get previous commit error. You can also `reword` if you want to eventually reword the git commit message.

```
reword c69e4d08 feat: replace run goals with swim goal
squash 4d6756ea chore: add example .env file
squash 3fbaca38 chore: remove unused named import
```

Hit `esc` and type `:wq` for write/quit.

If you chose `reword` for the commit you chose, edit the commit message.

It prompts to change commit message body with list of commits you just squashed.

Push changes up to origin. I sometimes I have to force push if git gets angry

```
git push origin HEAD --force
```

Show recent commits

```
git log -n 5
git show -3
```
