### Instructions from Cedric

Thank you for providing the CloudFormation template details. Based on this information, I'll update my guidance for pulling and running the latest Docker image for AnythingLLM:

1. First, stop and remove the existing container:

```bash
# Get container ID and store it in a variable
CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=mintplexlabs/anythingllm)
# Stop the container using the variable
docker stop $CONTAINER_ID
# Remove the container
docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter ancestor=mintplexlabs/anythingllm)
```

2. Pull the latest image:

```bash
docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm:latest
```

3. Run the new container with the latest image, using the same configuration as in your CloudFormation template:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  -v /home/ec2-user/anythingllm:/app/server/storage \
  -v /home/ec2-user/anythingllm/.env:/app/server/.env \
  -e STORAGE_DIR="/app/server/storage" \
  mintplexlabs/anythingllm:latest
```

4. Verify that the new container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

5. Check the health of the application:

```bash
curl -Is http://localhost:3001/api/ping | head -n 1 | cut -d$' ' -f2
```

Important notes based on your setup:

- The application data is stored in `/home/********/anythingllm`. This directory is mounted as a volume in the container, so your data will persist even when updating the container.
- The `.env` file is located at `/home/********/anythingllm/.env`. This file is also mounted in the container, so your environment variables are preserved.
- The container is run with the `SYS_ADMIN` capability, which gives it additional privileges.
- The application is exposed on port 3001.

Remember, if you need to make any changes to the environment variables, you should edit the `/home/********/anythingllm/.env` file before running the new container.

After running these commands, you should have the latest version of AnythingLLM running on your EC2 instance with the same configuration as specified in your CloudFormation template.
