# Troubleshooting AnythingLLM on AWS EC2

AnythingLLM deployed on AWS EC2 runs with Docker. If the app stops running, you need to restart it using Docker. To do that, you need to be able to SSH into the instance or connect using EC2 Instance Connect.

My deployment did not specify an SSH key pair to use when creating the instance via CloudFormation, so I cannot SSH manually into the instance.

## SSH into EC2 Instance Using EC2 Instance Connect

1. Create the endpoint if not created already.
2. Choose Connect.

## 502 Bad Gateway Error

If you encounter a 502 Bad Gateway error, it might be due to AnythingLLM stopping unexpectedly. Follow these steps to troubleshoot and restart the app using Docker.

### 1. Check if Docker is Installed and Running

First, ensure Docker is installed and running on your EC2 instance.

#### Check Docker Version

Run the following command to check the Docker version:

```sh
docker -v
```

You should get something like `Docker version 20.10.17, build ....`

#### Check Docker Daemon Status

Check if the Docker daemon is active:

```sh
sudo systemctl status docker
```

You should see `active (running).` If it’s not, start it:

```sh
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### 2. Look for Containers

List running containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

If you see a container named something like `anythingllm` (or similar) and it’s Up, it’s running. If it’s not listed, it might be stopped. Check all containers with:

```sh
sudo docker ps -a
```

(this shows containers that are stopped as well).

If you see a container for `anythingllm` but it’s exited, you can try to start it:

```sh
sudo docker start CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
```

Run `docker ps` again to see if it’s running. It will show this in `Status` when starting:

```sh
Up 22 seconds (health: starting)
```

After about 30 seconds, it should show up as `Up About a minute (healthy)`
