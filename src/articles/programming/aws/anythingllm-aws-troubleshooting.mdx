# 502 Bad Gateways error

I thought I had changed some networking setting or something that borked it. Somehow AnythingLLM stopped running. I had to restart the app. That had to be done via docker.

## 1. Check if Docker is Installed and Running

Check Docker version:

```
docker -v
```

You should get something like `Docker version 20.10.17, build ....`

Check if the Docker daemon is active:

```
sudo systemctl status docker
```

You should see `active (running).` If it’s not, start it:

```
sudo systemctl start docker
```

## 2. Look for Containers

List running containers:

```
docker ps
```

If you see a container named something like `anythingllm` (or similar) and it’s Up, it’s running. If it’s not listed, it might be stopped. Check all containers with:

```
sudo docker ps -a
```

(this shows containers that are stopped as well).

If you see a container for `anythingllm` but it’s exited, you can try to start it:

```
sudo docker start CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
```

Run `docker ps` again to see if it’s running.. It will show this in `Status` when starting:

```
Up 22 seconds (health: starting)
```

After about 30 seconds, it should show up as `Up About a minute (healthy)`
