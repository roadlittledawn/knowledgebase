Getting Session Manager running and adding VPC endpoints was a whole thing

that worked, but was not able to install cert. outpuot:

```bash
deploying certificate
Could not install certificate

NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate was saved, but could not be installed (installer: nginx). After fixing the error shown below, try installing it again by running:
  certbot install --cert-name ai.clangclangclang.com
- The certificate will need to be renewed before it expires. Certbot can automatically renew the certificate in the background, but you may need to take steps to enable that functionality. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup for instructions.

Could not automatically find a matching server block for ai.clangclangclang.com. Set the `server_name` directive to use the Nginx installer.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
