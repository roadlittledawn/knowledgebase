Simple script to deserialize serialized HTML back to MDX.

Assumptions:

- reads a file from root of project called `net-agent-config.html`. this should be the serialized HTML we get back from Smartling.
- writes a file to root of project called `net-agent-configuration.mdx`.

We could then run `yarn verify-mdx` on it to ensure it's parsable by `gatsby-plugin-mdx`.

```js
const deserializeHTML = require("./scripts/actions/deserialize-html");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

const translatedHtml = fs.readFileSync(
  path.join(process.cwd(), "net-agent-config.html"),
  "utf-8"
);

const deserializeTodMdx = async (translatedHtml) => {
  const mdx = await deserializeHTML(translatedHtml);
  return mdx;
};

deserializedToMdx(translatedHtml).then((res) =>
  fs.writeFileSync(
    path.join(process.cwd(), "net-agent-configuration.mdx"),
    res,
    "utf-8"
  )
);
```
